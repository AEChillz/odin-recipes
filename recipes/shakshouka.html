      <h1>Shakshuka Recipe</h1>
      <p>This is the best Shakshuka recipe ever</p>
      <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 
      <li>Vegetables</li>
      <li>Spices</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Fresh Herbs</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Saute the veggies</strong>Dice an onion and red bell pepper and add that to a saut√© pan with a little olive oil over medium heat. Stir the veggies for about 5 minutes, or until the onions become translucent. Then add the garlic and spices and stir for another minute, until the mixture is nice and fragrant.</li>
      <li><strong>Simmer the eggs on top</strong>- Pour in a 28-ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes and use your spatula to break up the tomatoes into smaller pieces. Once this entire mixture is lightly simmering, you can crack your eggs on top. Use your spatula to make little holes for the eggs, then crack an egg into each hole. I use six eggs, though depending on the size of your pan you may use more or less. Reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 5 to 8 minutes or until the eggs are done to your liking. </li>
      <li><strong>Garnish with fresh herbs</strong>- Before serving, season the eggs with salt and a generous amount of freshly chopped parsley and cilantro. Enjoy! </li>
